      <description>Is it possible to persuade others only by providing interpretations of future events? I study the general problem of manipulating a boundedly rational agent by controlling her interpretation of signals she is about to receive. Persuasion arises because the agent updates her beliefs and takes an action based on the narrative she finds most plausible given her prior beliefs. Leveraging this, not only is the persuader able to strategically manipulate the agent to maximize his expected utility, but he can also induce the agent to hold non Bayes-plausible beliefs across signal realizations.</description>

      <description>We study the effect of contingent thinking on belief updating. One possible explanation for biased beliefs is that agents distort the underlying data-generating process when updating their beliefs given a new piece of information. Engaging in contingent thinking – jointly assessing beliefs for all possible events without learning the realized one – might affect the agents’ understanding of the data-generating process, resulting in differences in belief updating. With a series of online experiments, we aim to uncover and decompose the effect of contingent thinking on belief distortions into two components: (1) hypothetical thinking (updating on a piece of not yet observed information) and (2) contrast reasoning (comparing multiple contingencies during the updating task).</description>
