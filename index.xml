      <title>Frustration and Anger in the Ultimatum game: An Experiment</title>

      <description>Is it possible to persuade others only by providing interpretations of future events? I study the general problem of manipulating a boundedly rational agent by controlling her interpretation of signals she is about to receive. Persuasion arises because the agent updates her beliefs and takes an action based on the narrative she finds most plausible given her prior beliefs. Leveraging this, not only is the persuader able to strategically manipulate the agent to maximize his expected utility, but he can also induce the agent to hold non Bayes-plausible beliefs across signal realizations.</description>

      <description>To what extent is it possible to manipulate beliefs by providing interpretations of unknown events? I characterize the feasible posteriors across signals when the agent is exposed to a set of models to interpret observable signals and adopts the model that best fits what is observed. Because each signal could trigger the adoption of a different model, posteriors across signal realizations might not average to the prior. The scope of persuasion is large, even for a persuader who does not control or know the signal the agent observes.</description>

      <title>Contingent Belief Updating</title>

      <description>We study the impact of contingent thinking on belief updating. Engaging in contingent thinking calls for both processing hypothetical information and contrasting multiple contingencies during the belief-updating process. Our experimental findings show that contingent thinking leads to significant deviations from Bayesian updating. These deviations arise from the diminished perceived informativeness of hypothetical signals and the challenges posed by asymmetric signals, where comparing contingencies becomes more difficult. These results have implications for contingent planning, information acquisition, and information design.</description>

      <title>Weighting Competing Models</title>

      <description>We study belief updating in the presence of competing data-generating processes, or models, that could explain observed data. Using a theory-driven experiment, we identify the weights individuals assign to different models. We find that the most prevalent updating rule assigns full weight to the model that best fits the data, reflecting overinference about the models. While some participants assign positive weights to multiple models&amp;mdash;consistent with Bayesian updating&amp;mdash;they often do so in a biased manner, reflecting underinference about the models.</description>

      <description>We study the competition among senders in the supply of models. For example, politicians compete to supply voters with models to interpret data on immigration or economic outcomes; brokers might want clients to interpret the same firmâ€™s performance differently, driven by different incentives. The senders&amp;rsquo; strategies and the receiver&amp;rsquo;s beliefs vary with respect to the incentives of the parties involved</description>
