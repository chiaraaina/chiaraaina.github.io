      <description>To what extent is it possible to manipulate beliefs by providing interpretations of unknown events? I characterize the feasible posteriors across signals when the agent is exposed to a set of models to interpret observable signals and adopts the model that best fits what is observed. Because each signal could trigger the adoption of a different model, posteriors across signal realizations might not average to the prior. The scope of persuasion is large, even for a persuader who does not control or know the signal the agent observes.</description>

      <title>Contingent Belief Updating</title>

      <description>We study the impact of contingent thinking on belief updating. Engaging in contingent thinking calls for both processing hypothetical information and contrasting multiple contingencies during the belief-updating process. Our experimental findings show that contingent thinking leads to significant deviations from Bayesian updating. These deviations arise from the diminished perceived informativeness of hypothetical signals and the challenges posed by asymmetric signals, where comparing contingencies becomes more difficult. These results have implications for contingent planning, information acquisition, and information design.</description>

      <title>Weighting Competing Models</title>

      <description>We study how individuals update their beliefs in the presence of competing data-generating processes, or models, that could explain observed data. Through experiments, we identify the weights participants assign to different models and find that the most common updating rule gives full weight to the model that best fits the data. While some participants assign positive weights to multiple models&amp;mdash;consistent with Bayesian updating&amp;mdash;they often do so in a systematically biased manner.</description>

      <title>Competing in Tailored Stories</title>

      <description>We study the competition among senders in the supply of models. For example, politicians compete to supply voters with models to interpret data on immigration or economic outcomes; brokers might want clients to interpret the same firmâ€™s performance differently, driven by different incentives. The senders&amp;rsquo; strategies and the receiver&amp;rsquo;s beliefs vary with respect to the incentives of the parties involved</description>
